      My name is Craig Leslie. I just turned 18 years old on September 26th.
       I'm a computer science major at the University at Buffalo. I was born in
       Hexham, England. Here are somethings I enjoy doing: reading, hanging out
       with friends, playing video games, listening to music, swimmming,
       golfing, and long walks on the beach at sunset with my dogs. I love dogs
