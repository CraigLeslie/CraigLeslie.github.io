      My name is Craig Leslie.
     </p>

     <p>
       I just turned 18 years old on September 26th.
      I was born in Hexham, England.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a computer science major at the University at Buffalo.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here are somethings I enjoy doing: reading, hanging out
          with friends, playing video games, listening to music, swimmming,
          golfing, and long walks on the beach at sunset with my dogs.
